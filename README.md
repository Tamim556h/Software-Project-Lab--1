# Sentiment Analyzer 
This project is a C++-based text emotion/sentiment classification system that identifies the emotion category of any user-given sentence.
It uses three different machine learning algorithms implemented fully from scratch without external libraries:

🔹 Vector Space Model (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)
🔹 Naïve Bayes Classifier
🔹 Logistic Regression (SGD + L2 Regularization)

The system is trained on a large labeled dataset and can classify user input in real time.
